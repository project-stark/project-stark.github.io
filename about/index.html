<p>
  Our project aims to implement a particular use case of Internet of Things, which is an IoT based
  Smart home. At the base of a smart home, IoT enabled devices generate staggering amount of
  data every second from sensors, actuators and switches. 
</p>

<p>
  Insights gained from that data open new doors for automation, analytics and security. Since
  every smart home has to be personalized, we use Machine learning so that the home can adapt to
  userâ€™s preferences.
